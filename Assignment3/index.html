            <p>My name is Joshua Bholan. I was born on June 18th 2004 in Saint James NY. Besides my parents, I have an older brother named Eric and an older sister Named Emily. I also have a dog named Toby. I have done many sports over the course of my life such as soccer, Baseball and basketball but the one I am best at and have done for the longest is bowling. I was on the High school bowling team and was MVP of my team on my 4th year of the 2020-2021 school year.Outside of sports I have known video games my whole life starting with a wii at age 2. I own many retro nintendo consoles and own an xbox 360. Playing games such as wii sports, Call of duty, Earthbound, Mario Kart and much more but the game that impacted me the most was Super Smash Bros. I am currently entering tournaments and trying to be better at the game. During Covid-19 I made some money attending and doing well at online Tournaments and have been trying to get better since.

                Going back to Bowling, Besides bowling for the high school team I have bowled in many Tournaments and it was my way of earning scholarships. I have been to conneticut,Indiana,Michigan, Maryland, Deleware,New Jersey and much more because of these bowling tournaments. Notable placements I have done recently was winning the NYC Bowling Youth Singles, Coming 5th in NY state pepsi Tournament and 92nd in Junior Gold, which is the biggest Bowling tournament having over 4000 diffent youth bowlers around the country.
